## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I significantly expanded my skillset in React and Node.js. I also delved into new technologies like Chakra UI, Firebase, TypeScript, and Recoil, pushing my boundaries as a developer. Inevitably, I encountered challenging bugs that took days to resolve. Through this process, I honed my problem-solving skills, leveraging online resources, meticulous code backups, extensive documentation review, and countless hours of dedicated analysis. This project proved to be a fun and rewarding experience, fostering my growth as a developer and encouraging me to tackle challenges independently before seeking external support.
